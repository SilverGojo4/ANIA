# ANIA: An Inception-Attention Network for Predicting Minimum Inhibitory Concentration of Antimicrobial Peptides

ANIA is a deep learning framework for predicting the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). It integrates Chaos Game Representation (CGR)-based sequence encoding with an Inception-Attention neural network to provide accurate MIC regression across multiple bacterial strains.

## Getting Started

This project provides a modular and command-line-driven pipeline via `main.py`, covering all stages from data collection to deep learning prediction.

### 1. Setup Conda Environments

```bash
# For deep learning (PyTorch + ANIA)
conda env create -f envs/ANIA_DL.yml

# For CGR encoding (requires R and kaos)
conda env create -f envs/ANIA_R.yml

# For classical ML and iFeature processing
conda env create -f envs/ANIA_Data.yml
```

### 2. Run the Pipeline via main.py

The pipeline consists of modular stages:

| Stage        | Description                                 |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| `collect`    | Collect raw AMP sequences and MIC values    |
| `clean`      | Clean and aggregate the dataset             |
| `group`      | Assign MIC groups (optional)                |
| `split`      | Stratified splitting into training/testing  |
| `ifeature`   | Extract iFeature features (AAC, PAAC, etc.) |
| `train_ml`   | Train ML models (e.g., SVM, RF, XGBoost)    |
| `test_ml`    | Evaluate ML models                          |
| `cgr`        | Encode sequences using CGR                  |
| `train_ania` | Train ANIA deep learning model              |
| `test_ania`  | Test ANIA model and export predictions      |
